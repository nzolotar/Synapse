Key improvements made:

SOLID Principles:
Single Responsibility: Separated concerns into OrderRepository, AlertService, and OrderProcessor
Open/Closed: Using interfaces for extensibility
Dependency Inversion: Using dependency injection
Interface Segregation: Specific interfaces for each responsibility


Testing improvements:

All dependencies are injectable
Created IHttpClientWrapper for mocking HTTP calls
Immutable records for data models
Pure functions where possible


DRY improvements:
Centralized HTTP client handling
Reusable configurations
Eliminated duplicate string content creation


Key points about this setup:

Single Solution Structure:

All business logic is in one project
Tests are in a separate project but same solution
Clear separation of concerns within the project


Testing Setup:

Using AutoFixture for test data generation
Using Moq for mocking dependencies
Using FluentAssertions for readable assertions
Using xUnit as the testing framework


The test example shows:

Proper test setup using constructor
Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
Mocking and verification
Testing both positive and negative scenarios
